                <p class="mx-auto">
                    We believe Teen Patti Master should always be an enjoyable, engaging, and social form of
                    entertainment. It is a game that blends skill, strategy, and an element of chance. For most players,
                    it remains a fun and positive experience. However, we also understand that, for a small number of
                    individuals, gaming may occasionally lose its sense of enjoyment. Our commitment is to deliver not
                    only an exciting gaming environment but also a safe and responsible one. Your well-being is our
                    highest priority, and we are dedicated to supporting a healthy, balanced, and secure gaming
                    experience for every member of our community.

                <p class="mx-auto">
                    Responsible gaming means enjoying the experience while knowing when to pause. Please take a moment
                    to thoughtfully reflect on the questions below:
                </p>

                <ul class="tick-list mx-auto mt-3">
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i>Do you sometimes spend more time or money on gaming than you planned?
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i>Do you continue playing to try and recover losses?</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i>Have you ever borrowed money or sold something so you could continue
                        gaming?</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i>Has gaming affected your relationships, work, studies, or daily
                        responsibilities?</li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i>Do you feel stressed, irritated, or anxious when you are not playing?
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i>Do you use gaming as a way to avoid worries or personal problems?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mx-auto mt-4">
                    If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, it may be the right time to review your gaming
                    habits or reach out for guidance. Acknowledging a concern is a positive and courageous first step
                    toward maintaining balance.
